# Deploy-Machine-Learning-Using-Docker

#### Why docker?
1. Build once deploy everywhere
2. Resources are isolated.
3. Environment standardization

#### Difference between docker container and virtual machines?
In virtual machines, physical resources get shared. You can split the resources between different virtual machines.
RAM, storage, network, CPU etc. get shared. On the other hand, in docker container, operating systems get splitted. 
You can reallocate different resources to different docker images.
